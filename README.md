# [JSL07] Submission: Proud of your Progress

For this challenge, I had to create a personalized certificate of achievement with the "Proud of Your Progress Certificate Generator". This web application requires users to input their name, a personalized message, and the course name to dynamically generate a certificate displayed in a modal. The input values are checked to see if they are completed before the certificate is generated and once the certificate is generated, it can be closed with a click button.
